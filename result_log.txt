12 (Skor: 0.2405): some structural and aerelastic considerations of high
speed flight .
  the dominating factors in structural design of high-speed
aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin .  the subject
matter is concerned largely with a discussion of these factors and
their interrelation with one another .  a summary is presented
of some of the analytical and experimental tools available to
aeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flight
upon aircraft structures .  the state of the art with respect to
heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modes
of failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs and
acrothermoelasticity is discussed .  methods of attacking and
alleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speed
flight are summarized .  finally, some avenues of fundamental
research are suggested .
502 (Skor: 0.1847): on squire's test of the compressibility transformation .
  discussion of a previous application, by squire, of the author's
compressibility transformation to the correlation of high-speed
boundary-layer data for air and helium .  squire's suggestion that
the compressibility transformation is invalid is shown to be
incorrect .
203 (Skor: 0.1832): calculated velocity distributions and force derivatives
for a series of high-speed aerofoils .
  the polygon method of woods is used to
calculate the velocity distribution over a number of
two-dimensional aerofoils at low incidence, subcritical flows only
being considered .  lift slopes and aerodynamic centres
at zero lift are also calculated .
  some comparisons with experimental results are made, and
these show good agreement at zero incidence .
1063 (Skor: 0.1673): on obtaining solutions to the navier-stokes equations
with high speed digital computers .
  the purpose of this paper is
to show how to obtain steady
state solutions to the navier-stokes
equations on a high-speed digital
computer .  first the relative merits
of various finite difference
formulae are discussed .  thereafter
the main part of the paper is
concerned with the methods used to
solve the finite difference
equations and an investigation is made
of all the simpler iterative
methods .
38 (Skor: 0.1631): on the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressure
distributions .
  high-speed wind-tunnel results are analyzed to derive a
semiempirical scheme for the prediction of transonic pressure
distributions .  the supersonic and subsonic parts of the flow are
treated separately, and then linked by an empirical shock
pressure rise relation .  the significance of the empirical results is
considered in relation to the physical mechanism of transonic
flows .  it is also shown that theoretical solutions can be
improved by introducing the empirical shock relation .
